# DSMIL: Dual-stream multiple instance learning networks for tumor detection in Whole Slide Image
This is the Pytorch implementation for the multiple instance learning model described in the paper [Dual-stream Multiple Instance Learning Network for Whole Slide Image Classification with Self-supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.08939).

## Installation
Install [anaconda/miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  
Required packages
```
  $ conda env create --name dsmil --file env.yml
  $ conda activate dsmil
```

## Features preparation
The MIL benchmark dataset can be downloaded via:
```
  $ python download.py --dataset=mil
```

Precomputed features for [TCGA Lung Cancer dataset](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.cases.primary_site%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22bronchus%20and%20lung%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.data_format%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22svs%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.experimental_strategy%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22Diagnostic%20Slide%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D) can be downloaded via:  
```
  $ python download.py --dataset=tcga
```
This dataset requires 20GB of free disk space. 

If you are processing WSI from raw images, you will need to download the WSIs first.  
1. Navigate to './tcga-download/'
```
  $ cd tcga-download
```
2. Download WSIs from [TCGA data portal](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/Getting_Started/) using the manifest file and configuration file. The example shows the case of Windows operating system. The WSIs will be saved in './WSI/TCGA-lung/LUAD' and './WSI/TCGA-lung/LUSC'. The raw WSIs take about 1TB disc space and may take several days to download. Open command line tool, navigate to ./tcga-download, and use:
```
  $ gdc-client -m gdc_manifest.2020-09-06-TCGA-LUAD.txt --config config-LUAD.dtt
  $ gdc-client -m gdc_manifest.2020-09-06-TCGA-LUSC.txt --config config-LUSC.dtt
```    
3. Prepare the patches. We will be using [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/), a C library with a [Python API](https://pypi.org/project/openslide-python/) that provides a simple interface to read WSI data. We refer the users to [OpenSlide Python API document](https://openslide.org/api/python/) for the details of using this tool. The patches will be saved in './WSI/TCGA-lung/pyramid' in a pyramidal structure for the magnifications of 20x and 5x. Navigate to './tcga-download/OpenSlide/bin' and run the script 'TCGA-pre-crop.py'  
```
  $ python TCGA-pre-crop.py
```
* For training your embedder, we refer the users to [Pytorch implementation of SimCLR](https://github.com/sthalles/SimCLR). You will need to feed your WSI patches to the SimCLR framework with "input_shape" argument set as the size of the WSI patch in the configuration file (config.yml).  

## Training on default datasets
To train DSMIL on standard MIL benchmark dataset:
```
  $ python train_mil.py
```
To switch between MIL benchmark dataset, use option:
 ```
 [--datasets]      # musk1, musk2, elephant, fox, tiger
 ```
 Other options are available for learning rate (0.0002), cross validation fold (5), weight-decay (5e-3), and number of epochs (40).  
 
 To train DSMIL on TCGA Lung Cancer dataset:
 ```
  $ python train_tcga.py
```

## Training on your own datasets
You could modify train_tcga.py to easily let it work with your datasets. You will need to:  
1. For each bag, generate a .csv file where each row contains the feature of an instance. The .csv file should be named as "_bagID_.csv" and put into a folder named "_dataset-name_".  
2. Generate a "_dataset-name_.csv" file with two columns where the first column contains _bagID_, and the second column contains the class label.
3. Replace the corresponding file path in the script with the file path of "_dataset_.csv" file, and change the data directory path in the dataloader to the path of the folder "_dataset-name_"
4. Configure the number of class for creating the DSMIL model.
